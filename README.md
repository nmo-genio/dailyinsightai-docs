# 📘 DailyInsightAI Docs — Attempt 1,2,3...... nope

This is my x attempt at creating a documentation site for the DailyInsightAI project using Nextra templates.

The goal: build a **clean, crisp-looking** documentation experience using modern tools.

🌐 **Live vercel working version**: [https://dailyinsightai-docs-o4gnfys4b-nmo-genios-projects.vercel.app/](https://dailyinsightai-docs-o4gnfys4b-nmo-genios-projects.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 Project Description

This repo contains the structure and content for a documentation site built with **Nextra**, a Next.js-based static site generator.

- ✍️ Focus: Simplicity and clear navigation
- 🎯 Purpose: Document the development journey and features of the [DailyInsightAI](https://github.com/nmo-genio/dailyinsightai) app
- 🎨 Look: Crisp, minimalistic — still a work in progress
- ⚠️ Challenges: Hard to customize, and managing dependencies can feel like a nightmare
  (even WindSurf couldn’t build this using the latest Nextra theme-docs version)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Nextra](https://nextra.site/)
- **Language**: Markdown / MDX

## 🚀 Deployment

To build and deploy the documentation site locally or to a platform like Vercel:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# (Optional) Start a local server to preview the build
npm run start
```

> 📝 For production, connect this repo to Vercel or your preferred hosting provider and enable automatic deployments from the `main` branch.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```bash
src/
└── content/
    └── page.mdx        # Just a sample page for testing layout and structure
```

## Disclaimer
With latest nextra version I could not build successfully this project. You can give it a try making use what I worked on.
